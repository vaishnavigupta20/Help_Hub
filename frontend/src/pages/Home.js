          <p className="lead">
            HelpHub connects people in crisis with volunteers, donors, and NGOs in real time.
            By sharing your location and a photo, you make it easy for helpers nearby to understand
            the situation and act fast—whether it’s food for a needy family, a lost pet, urgent blood,
            or an injured stray animal.

            <h3>Why Use HelpHub?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Real‑time, location‑based help</strong>—requests are matched to nearby volunteers and donors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Photo + location verification</strong>—uploading images and coordinates reduces fake requests.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>End‑to‑end tracking</strong>—you can see when a helper accepts, arrives, or marks a request as completed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Community‑powered</strong>—neighbors, NGOs, and local blood/medicine donors work together to respond faster than scattered WhatsApp groups.
              </li>
            </ul>
